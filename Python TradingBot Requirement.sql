Liquidity = Average daily volumes / Market capitalization >> minimum liquidity ratio of 10%
prefer stocks that are liquid and widely owned
you look at stocks that are extremely sensitive to news
use stop-losses
falling stocks have a habit of declining
when the index or the sector ticks upward, the individual stocks price also increases
During an uptrend, focus on taking long positions
Trade strong stocks in an uptrend, weak stocks in a downtrend.
When entering a long position, buy after the price moves down toward the trendline and then moves back higher. To draw an upward trendline, a price low and then a higher price low is needed. The line is drawn connecting these two points and then extended out to the right.
In an uptrend or long position, take profits at or slightly above the former price high in the current trend.
Place a stop-loss just below the most recent low prior to entry on a buy signal
If the price is moving in a range (not trending), switch to a range-bound trading strategy. --SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE
